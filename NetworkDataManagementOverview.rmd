# Introduction

Spring 2025 has brought significant change and uncertainty to the National Park Service's Arctic Network (ARCN) Inventory and Monitoring Program. As a science-based initiative, we recognize that data forms the foundation of our understanding of park resources. Given our role as a long-term ecological monitoring program, data preservation remains our foremost priority. In times of uncertainty, it is essential to proactively manage and mitigate risks to our data. This brief provides an overview of the current state of the Arctic Network's data management resources, archives, and systems, with the goal of facilitating a seamless return to full operations in the event of any interruptions.

The ARCN relies heavily on a shared file server, an SQL Server database server, and the National Park Service's Integrated Resources Management Applications (IRMA) system for management of files and data produced by the program. A description of each of each of these systems follows:

# Data Management Systems

## Shared network drive

ARCN's shared network drive (the O:\\ drive) is the workbench for day to day data processing operations. Each Vital Sign has its own directory and ARCN personnal are expected to keep it up to date with data products as they proceed through the scientific life cycle. The O:\\ drive hosted on a server at the Fairbanks Administrative Center (FAC) and jointly administered by the Central Alaska I&M Network (CAKN) and Information Technology staff of Yukon-Charley Rivers/Gates of the Arctic. The current virtual machine UNC path is \\\\inpyugastorage\ARCN\ARCN. The file server is in a locked server room and backed up nightly. Off-site rotation of backup devices happens on a regular schedule to the Fairbanks Public Lands Information Center. Backups devices are encrypted with BitLocker. FAC IT staff and the data manager have the BitLocker passwords.

## Microsoft SQL Server

ARCN relies on three Microsoft SQL Servers for project and data management:

1.  inp2300irmadb01\ntwk. We have a database, AKRO, used for project management. This SQL Server is hosted in the NPS Denver Service Center. Management and backups are managed by NPS.

2.  inpyugamsvm01\nuna and inpyugamsvm01\nuna\_dev. Nuna is our production server and nuna_dev is the development server. Databases are in various states of development on these SQL Servers for the Lagoons, Lakes, Moose, Muskox, Shallow Lakes, Terrestrial Vegetation and Soils, Terrestrial Landscape Patterns and Dynamics and Loons monitoring protocols. Administration and backups are done by FAC and CAKN.

3.  inpakrovmais. This SQL Server is hosted by the Alaska Region GIS team and ARCN uses the Animal_Movement database to manage GPS collar data for caribou, sheep, moose and muskox Vital Signs. Administration and backups are done by the AK Regional GIS team and IT staff.

## Integrated Resource Management Applications system

IRMA is the public face of the ARCN. Each Vital Sign has a Project Reference to which products such as reports, journal articles and datasets are published. We also publish mission critical documents such as monitoring protocols, standard operating procedures, data quality standards and quality assurance plans in IRMA. Each Vital Sign Project Reference can be found by using the [ARCN Program Reference](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2208369) as a starting point.
